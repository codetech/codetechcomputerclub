codeTech Computer Club (Website)
=======

codeTech Computer Club was founded at Mira Costa College Oceanside in early-2013. Our goal was to bring together students, graduates, teachers, and industrymen, all who were aspiring to enter or who had experience in technology fields. We would share our knowledge and build great things together.

codeTech's website serves a few purposes:

* Prospective members can learn about and join the club.
* Members can present what they've created.
* Members can share resources with each other.
